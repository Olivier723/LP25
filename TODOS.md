# TODOS :
- Finish is_configuration_valid and make configuration
- Warning in analysis.c
- test next_dir in utility.c
- file help for the getopt (Oazin)
- Ask the teacher how to sync the file in files_list_reducer

# NOTICE :
- sprintf() is maybe deprecated

# WHAT I UNDERSTAND :
- direct_fork_directory creates a directory_task_t with process_directory as its call back function (I guess)
